  Hey there! I'm Sanjib Kumar Sen, a software engineer with a knack for making machines understand human languages (yes, it's as cool as it sounds). I graduated from BRAC University with a CGPA of 3.67, acing courses like Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures. But enough about grades—let's talk about the fun stuff.

I've built some pretty nifty things in my development career. Ever heard of an Automated Speech Recognition system? Well, I’ve created one that's scalable both horizontally and vertically (fancy, right?). I’ve dabbled in speaker diarization, topic classification, and named entity recognition—basically, making sense of the chaos in audio recordings and texts.

At Technometrics, I developed a military recruitment platform that can handle high volumes of requests without breaking a sweat. My stint at Project Waitless saw me whipping up web apps and automation tools that made managing European pubs and clubs a breeze. I’ve also built Shopify apps that generated some serious revenue and crafted custom CRM solutions with AI support because why not?

GitHub thought it would be a cool idea to keep me on Monthly Top Trending list for <a class="underline decoration-dashed underline-offset-4 hover:text-skin-accent" href="https://github.com/sanjib-sen/weblatex">WebLaTeX</a> and <a class="underline decoration-dashed underline-offset-4 hover:text-skin-accent" href="https://envshh.js.org">envshh</a>. I honestly think they were just exaggerating.

When I’m not coding up a storm, I’m mentoring students, organizing tech events, and occasionally winning competitive programming contests. I’ve even got a few research publications under my belt.

Now, I’m setting my sights on a PhD in NLP to dive even deeper into the world of machines and languages. Let’s see where this journey takes me—hopefully somewhere awesome and full of even more geeky adventures!
