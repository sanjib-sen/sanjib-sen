# ApplyTexas Has a Hidden Bug Blocking International Students - How I Reverse-Engineered the Website Network Calls to Solve It for My Own PhD Application

## üö® **Deadline Approaching. My PhD Dreams Were in Jeopardy.**

Picture this: You're an international student with **very little time left** to submit your PhD application to Texas universities. Your F1 visa timeline is already tight. You need that I-20 document ASAP or your entire academic future crumbles.

Then ApplyTexas decides to throw a wrench in everything.

## **The Digital Nightmare Begins**

After spending days crafting the perfect application, I hit submit and... 

**ERROR. "About You" section incomplete.**

*Wait, what?* I'd filled every single field. Triple-checked everything. The main dashboard shows 100% completion of "Core Questions". The form looked complete, but the system was saying otherwise.

*Caption: My contact form, completely filled out but somehow "incomplete"*

With my SWE background, I knew something was wrong. But I also knew I had **very limited time** to either fix this or watch my PhD opportunity slip away.

## **Plot Twist: The Hidden System Flaw**

After hours of debugging (yes, I was THAT desperate, also thanks to my adrenaline rush whenever I find a bug), I discovered something that shocked me:

‚úÖ **Put in ANY US address** ‚Üí Application submits perfectly  
‚ùå **Use my real Bangladesh address** ‚Üí System breaks  

The system had a critical flaw that specifically affected international students - and nobody seemed to know about it.

## **Going Full Detective Mode**

Time for some digital forensics. I fired up Edge DevTools like I always do everytime I see a bug (force of habit, thanks work).

*Caption: The smoking gun - US address sends state "AL", Bangladesh sends "null"*

**THE DISCOVERY:** 
- US students: `"permanentState": "AL"` ‚úÖ
- International students: `"permanentState": null` ‚ùå

The backend was rejecting null state values, but the frontend only sent states for US addresses. **Classic validation mismatch that nobody had tested for international users.**

## **The Make-or-Break Decision: Hack or Give Up?**

With my deadline rapidly approaching, I had two choices:
1. Accept defeat and miss the opportunity
2. Manually modify the API request and fix it myself

Guess which one I chose? üíª

## **The 30-Second Engineering Solution That Saved Everything**

Here's where my SWE skills came in clutch:

1. **Intercepted** the failed network request
2. **Modified** the payload: `"permanentState": null` ‚Üí `"permanentState": "Dhaka"`
3. **Resent** the request manually
4. **BOOM** - Application status changed to complete

*Caption: All sections finally showing as complete - PhD dreams back on track!*

## **The Real Problem**

This bug has probably affected **THOUSANDS** of international students applying to Texas universities. Students who don't have coding backgrounds just... get stuck.

How many brilliant minds never made it to Texas because of this overlooked technical issue?

```javascript
// The invisible barrier
"permanentState": null  // üíÄ Applications die here
```

## **For My Fellow International Students**

If you're reading this in a panic about your application deadline, here's your technical lifeline:

### **The Developer Workaround:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Submit your international address 
3. Find the failed POST request
4. Right-click ‚Üí "Edit and Resend"
5. Change `"permanentState": null` to `"permanentState": "YourCity"`
6. Hit Send
7. Watch your application magically become "complete"

## **The Happy Ending**

**Update:** I successfully got into my PhD program and am now working on my F1 visa process.

But I keep thinking - what if I wasn't a software engineer? What if I'd just accepted the broken system and given up?

## **Dear ApplyTexas Development Team**

If you're reading this: there's a simple fix that could help thousands of students:

```diff
// Current problematic logic
- Backend expects permanentState for ALL countries
+ Backend should allow null permanentState for non-US countries
```

Or alternatively:
```diff
// Frontend fix
- Only send permanentState for US addresses
+ Send permanentState for all countries (use city/region for international)
```

**üí° Pro Tip:** Always check the Network tab when forms mysteriously "fail." That error message might be hiding a simple technical issue with an even simpler solution.
